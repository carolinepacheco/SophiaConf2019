# MACHINE LEARNING OPEN STUDIO (MLOS)

The purpose of this workshop is to provide a comprehensive overview of the Machine Learning Open Studio (MLOS) platform from ActiveEon. It empowers data engineers and data scientists to quickly create structured workflows.  MLOS provides a rich set of generic machine learning tasks that can be connected together to build powerful  machine learning workflows for various aplications such as: fraud detection, anomaly detection, image recognition, etc.MLOS is ready-to use open source machine learning and deep learning libraries, such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, CNTK, among others.
